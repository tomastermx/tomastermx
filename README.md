👋 Hi! I'm Tomás, a backend developer passionate about building real-world web applications using Node.js and Express.

While I haven't worked in a formal developer role yet, I've completed several backend projects that simulate real freelance or production-level systems — including an ERP platform with modular architecture, secure authentication, and multi-database integration.

🛠️ **Core Technologies:**
- Node.js · Express · Sequelize (PostgreSQL) · Mongoose (MongoDB)
- Passport.js (JWT & sessions) · Helmet · express-session · Joi
- Firebase (Realtime DB & Auth)
- jQuery · Bootstrap (for lightweight frontend UIs)

📚 **Also learning:**  
- NestJS (2 certifications completed)  
- Applying architectural patterns, TypeScript fundamentals, and modular backend structure

📌 **Highlighted Projects:**
- A full-featured ERP backend with authentication, input validation, RBAC, and API structuring
- A Firebase-based real-time app with frontend interaction and auth
- A task manager app with session-based login and MongoDB storage

💬 I'm open to backend developer roles, freelance opportunities, or collaborative projects. Let's connect and build something meaningful!
